    "about1": "Pizza Hut first opened in Malaysia in 1982, with its restaurant located in the modest Plaza Yow Chuan, Kuala Lumpur. Today, the Pizza Hut chain had grown into more than 428 restaurants under its sole franchisee, QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd. With extensive collaborations in top tier breeder and contract broiler farming, hatchery, poultry production and processing, Pizza Hut is without a doubt an immense host of ancillary businesses as well, including baking, commissary and sauce production.",
    "about2": "As the largest pizza chain in Malaysia, Pizza Hut has truly come a long way from its humble beginnings- even with more than 500 Pizza Hut restaurants throughout Malaysia and Singapore under its belt, Pizza Hut still managed to consistently deliver on its main goal-that is providing delicious, piping hot pizza and smiles of happiness to all customers throughout Malaysia."
